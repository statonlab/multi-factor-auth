# Multifactor Authentication for Laravel

This package aims to provide easy multifactor authentication and identitiy verification for Laravel applications.
It allows developers to send verification codes to the user's email or other channels and provides the forms necessary to verify the code. This package does
not provide a way to integrate with one time token providers such as Google Authenticator. A main goal of this package is to be standalone and have no dependencies.
